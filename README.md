# rusty-dungeon

## Playing Instructions

None: this is not a game, this project is for me to learn [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) 🙂

## Development Instructions

Something like:

1. Install Rust and cargo
1. Install [direnv](https://direnv.net/)
1. `sudo apt install cmake pkg-config libfontconfig1-dev libfontconfig`
1. `cargo run`

## Context

I like writing games to learn new programming languages.

So after having written [Dungeon Mercenary](https://smelc3.itch.io/dungeon-mercenary) and
[Rogue vs Evil](https://smelc3.itch.io/rogue-vs-evil) in Java,
and [Pixel Card Wars](https://github.com/smelc/miso-darkcraw) in Haskell;
I'm now doing an ASCII roguelike in rust 🎉.
